# Astro の開発テンプレートを作成しました。

以下パッケージがインストール済みです。

- Prettier
- husky
- eslint

今後以下パッケージを追加していく予定です。

- stylelint

[`Astro Starter Kit: Minimal`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/minimal) をもとに作成しました。

## Developing

```sh
# package install
npm install

# prepare husky
npm run prepare

# start developing
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
